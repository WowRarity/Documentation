# Report a Problem

If none of this is helping or something important is missing, please let us know! You can contact the development team as follows:

* Leave a comment on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rarity): Please note that sometimes Curse doesn't send notifications and we can't fix this
* Comment or open a ticket on [WowAce](https://www.wowace.com/projects/rarity): The same notification issue exists here, unfortunately, so we might miss it
* Post a message in the [Rarity Discord](https://discord.gg/sQ3UqtSh6m): Please make sure to use the appropriate channels or your message may be deleted
* Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity): This is the prefered way of tracking bugs and feature requests, but for questions we recommend Discord

You should carefully read the [FAQ](/docs/faq) before posting, as your question might already be answered there. See also: [Known Issues](/docs/known-issues)

:::caution Important

Please refrain from sending personal messages to individual team members, and use the public channels instead! This way, you allow everyone to benefit and others can pitch in to assist you, which means you're likely to get a better response faster.
